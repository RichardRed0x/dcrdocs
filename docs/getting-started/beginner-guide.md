## Welcome To Decred 

This beginner's guide introduces the project, and offers signposts to some useful pages and platforms.

Decred is an autonomous digital currency. Stakeholders make and enforce the blockchain's consensus rules, set a course for future development, and decide how the project's treasury is used to fund it. Decred's blockchain is similar to Bitcoin's, but with major aspects of [governance](/governance/governance/) baked into the protocol. 

[Proof of Work](/mining/proof-of-work/) miners play a similar role for Decred as they do for Bitcoin, but with Decred they only receive 60% of the block reward.

[Ticket Voting](/mining/proof-of-stake/) is central to Decred's governance. Decred holders can time-lock (or "stake") chunks of DCR to buy tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain, this involves both approving the work of PoW Miners and voting Yes/No on any open [rule change proposals](/getting-started/user-guides/agenda-voting/). 30% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.

The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into a [Project Treasury fund](). Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through [Politeia proposals and voting](/).

The [Decred Constitution](/getting-started/constitution/) sets out some guiding principles for the project, this is also subject to amendment through Politeia proposal.

## Wallets

[Decrediton](/getting-started/user-guides/decrediton-setup/) is Decred's GUI wallet, it supports Voting through [Voting Service Providers](https://decred.org/stakepools/) and offers the easiest way to start buying tickets and participating in governance.

There is also a [Command Line Interface](/getting-started/user-guides/cli-installation/) and set of tools for more advanced users, these include running a personal Voting wallet.
